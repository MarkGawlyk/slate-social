                        We noticed that while climbing has exploded in popularity, the software powering the gyms hasn't kept pace. Existing solutions were clunky, outdated, and often frustrated the very people they were meant to help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We combined our love for the sport with our expertise in building modern software products. The result is Slate—a platform that respects the unique culture of climbing gyms while providing the robust, enterprise-grade tools needed to run a successful business.
