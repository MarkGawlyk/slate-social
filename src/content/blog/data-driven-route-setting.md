Route setting is an art, but it should be informed by science. Relying solely on the setter's intuition can lead to style biases and frustrated members.

## The Feedback Loop

Allow members to log ascents and rate routes via the Slate app. Are certain grades consistently getting "sandbagged" ratings? Is the V3 circuit getting ignored this week?

## Distribution Analysis

Visualize your gym's difficulty curve. A healthy commercial gym typically follows a bell curve distribution, with the bulk of routes in the V3-V5 range. Slate's dashboard can show you exactly how your current set matches up against this ideal.

## Setter Rotation

Data can also reveal setter habits. If one setter consistently sets "reachy" moves, the feedback data will highlight this pattern, allowing for constructive coaching and a more balanced product for your customers.
