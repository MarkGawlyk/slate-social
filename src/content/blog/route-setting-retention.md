If you own a coffee shop, your beans are your product. If you own a climbing gym, your routes are your product. You can have the best espresso machine (or campus board) in the world, but if the product is stale, people won't return.

## Turnover Velocity

How often should you reset? The industry standard is shifting.
- **Old School:** Reset a wall once a month.
- **New School:** Reset a section 1-2 times a week.

Frequent turnover creates a "FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out) effect. "I have to go to the gym tonight because the slab wall resets tomorrow!"

## Density vs. Quality

There is a fine line.
- **Too Dense:** The wall looks cluttered, holds overlap, and down-climbing becomes a hazard.
- **Too Sparse:** Customers feel like they aren't getting value for money.

Aim for "clean density." Use monochromatic setting to clearly define lines while packing the wall efficiently.

## Setting for Every Body

Route setting often suffers from "Setter Bias." If all your setters are 6-foot tall men, your routes will favor big moves.

**Diversity in Setting:**
Ensure your setting team tests routes for:
1.  **Height:** Can a 5'2" climber reach the start hold?
2.  **Morphology:** Is this move only possible if you have massive hands?
3.  **Style:** Do you have static technical climbs as well as dynamic dynos?

A diverse setting team creates a diverse climbing community.
