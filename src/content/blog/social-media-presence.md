In the age of infinite scroll, specific beta videos are cool, but they aren't what builds a loyal gym membership. People join gyms for the facility, but they stay for the community. Your social media should reflect that.

## Highlight the Crushers AND the Gumbies

It's tempting to only repost the local crusher flashing the pink V8 in the cave. But that can be intimidating.

**Try this instead:**
1.  **Member Spotlights:** "Meet Dave, he's been projecting the blue V3 for three weeks and finally sent it today!"
2.  **Staff Intros:** Who are the people behind the desk? What's their favorite snack at the cafe?
3.  **Fail Compilations (Respectful ones):** Show that falling is part of the sport. It humanizes the struggle.

## The Power of the Repost

Encourage your members to tag the gym. When you repost their stories (with permission), you aren't just creating content; you are validating their belonging to the tribe.

> **Tip:** Create a dedicated "photo op" wall in your gym with good lighting and your branding. It encourages user-generated content naturally.

## Consistency Over Perfection

You don't need a RED camera to run an Instagram account. A candid iPhone shot of a high-five after a send conveys more emotion than a polished corporate promo video.

Keep it real, keep it consistent, and focus on the *people*, not just the plastic.
