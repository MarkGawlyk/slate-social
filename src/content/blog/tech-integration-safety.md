Safety is the number one priority in any climbing facility. While good mats and staff training are essential, technology plays a crucial, often overlooked role in risk management.

## Digital Waivers are Just the Start

Moving from paper to digital waivers isn't just about saving trees. It's about searchable, instantly accessible databases in case of emergencies. Slate's waiver system flags expired waivers automatically at check-in.

## Incident Reporting

When accidents happen, documentation is key. A digital incident log allows you to track patterns over time. Are injuries happening on specific wall angles? During specific times? Data can reveal safety blind spots you might miss.

## Access Control

Ensure that only inducted members can access 24-hour zones using integrated turnstiles. Your software should know who has completed the necessary safety checks before the gate opens.
