Climbers often care deeply about the environment. Aligning your gym's operations with these values isn't just good ethics—it's good business.

## Energy Efficiency in Large Spaces

Heating and cooling a warehouse space is expensive. Smart HVAC systems controlled by occupancy sensors (which Slate can integrate with) ensure you aren't heating empty zones.

## Hold Washing & Waste

Route setting involves cleaning thousands of holds. Investing in filtration systems for your pressure washing station prevents microplastics and resin sludge from entering the water system. 

## Retail Choices

Curate your pro-shop with brands that prioritize sustainability. It sends a message to your members about what your brand stands for.
