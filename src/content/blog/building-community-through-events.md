A climbing gym is more than just a place to workout; it's a "third place" for many—a social hub outside of home and work. Hosting the right kind of events can cement this status and drive incredible loyalty.

## Not Just Competitions

While local comps are a staple, think broader. Movie nights, gear swap meets, and "new climber socials" can attract different segments of your audience.

## The "Beta Breaker" Nights

Host a weekly session where staff help members work on specific "project" boulders. It fosters interaction between different skill levels and makes your staff approachable experts.

## Measuring Success

Don't just count heads. Look at repeat visits in the weeks following an event. Use your analytics tools (and Slate Social when available) to track if event attendees are converting to members at a higher rate.
